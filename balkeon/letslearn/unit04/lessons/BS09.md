# Lesson 05: Modification Particles

In Balkeon, modification particles play a crucial role in altering the meaning of verbs and enhancing sentence structure. This lesson delves into the usage of `Nek`, prepositions, and modal verbs as modification particles, explaining their sequencing and combination in two primary sentence structures: Normal Form and Modificational Form.

## Understanding Modification Particles

### Types of Modification Particles

1. **Nek**:
    - Used to indicate negation (no, don't).
    - Example: "Gonir atselin nek." (Don't go inside of that.)

2. **Prepositions**:
    - Provide context or define relationships within a sentence.
    - With nouns, prepositions transform into suffixes.
        - Example: "O konip yereonin." (He ran inside the house.)
    - With verbs, prepositions can transform into prefixes or be used as separate modification particles.
        - Example as Prefix: "O ingonir." (He goes in.)
        - Example as Separate Particle: "O konip in." (He runs inside.)

3. **Modal Verbs**:
    - Express necessity, possibility, permission, or ability.
    - **Normal Form**: ModalVerb + Tense (kadir formation: kad root ir tense) + ModifiedVerb + ian (agdian formation: agd root ian tense infinitive)
    - Example: "Aye dab ingonian." (I must go inside.)
    - Example: "Aye bolir ingonian." (I want to go inside.)

### Sentence Structure with Modification Particles

In Balkeon, sentences can be structured in two main ways when using modification particles:

#### 1. **Normal Form**
- **Order**: ModalVerb + Verb + Direct Object + Indirect Object
  - Example: "I must go inside."
  - Balkeon: "Aye dabir ingonian."
  
In this structure, the modal verb precedes the main verb, followed by the direct and indirect objects.

#### 2. **Modificational Form**
- **Order**: Verb + Direct Object + Indirect Object + Modification Particles (including modal)
  - Example: "I must go inside of that."
  - Balkeon: "Aye gonir atselin dab."
  
In this form, the main verb comes first, followed by the objects, and ending with the modification particles.

### Sequencing and Stacking of Modification Particles

1. **Order**:
    - The typical order for modification particles is: Preposition â†’ Modal Verb â†’ `Nek`.

2. **Maximum Stack**:
    - It's recommended to limit the stack of modification particles to two. Exceeding this is considered informal.

### Practical Examples

#### Using Nek

- **Negation**:
    - English: "Don't go inside of that."
    - Balkeon: "Gonir atselin nek."

#### Using Prepositions

- **With Nouns as Suffixes**:
    - English: "He ran inside the house."
    - Balkeon: "O konip yereonin."

- **With Verbs as Prefix or Separate Particle**:
    - English: "He goes in."
    - Balkeon: "O ingonir." (Prefix)
    - English: "He runs inside."
    - Balkeon: "O konip in." (Separate Particle)

#### Using Modal Verbs

- **Normal Form**:
    - English: "I must go inside."
    - Balkeon: "Aye dab ingonian."
    - English: "I want to go inside."
    - Balkeon: "Aye bolir ingonian."

- **Modificational Form**:
    - English: "I must go inside of that."
    - Balkeon: "Gonir atselin dab."

### Modal Verbs as Modification Particles

When a modal verb is placed in the modification particle slot, the main verb adopts the tense, and the auxiliary/modal verb is reduced to its root, stripped of any tense markers.

- **Peeling Off Tense**:
    - Example: "I must go inside of that."
    - Balkeon: "Dab gonir atselin."

## Practical Application

By mastering these modification particles and adhering to their rules, you can significantly enhance your proficiency in constructing nuanced and complex sentences in Balkeon. Practice applying these particles in various contexts to gain fluency and confidence.
