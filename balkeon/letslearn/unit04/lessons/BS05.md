# Lesson 03: Adpositions

In Balkeon, adpositions play an essential role in constructing meaningful and contextually rich sentences. Unlike many languages that strictly use prepositions (words placed before the noun), Balkeon uses adpositions, which can be placed before (prepositions) or after (postpositions) the noun phrase they modify. This flexibility allows for a more versatile and expressive language structure.

## Understanding Adpositions

### Types of Adpositions

1. **Prepositions**:
    - Placed before the noun or pronoun.
    - Example: "I am in the house" -> "Aye estir in yereon"

2. **Postpositions**:
    - Placed after the noun or pronoun.
    - Example: "The book is on the table" -> "Bukeon estir tebleon on"

### How Adpositions Work

1. **Flexibility**:
    - Adpositions in Balkeon can adapt to different positions around the noun or pronoun they modify, offering a high degree of flexibility. This allows for various sentence structures and emphasizes different parts of the sentence.

2. **Creating Context**:
    - By using adpositions, speakers can provide specific contextual information about the relationship between different elements in a sentence. This helps to clarify the meaning and enhance the detail of the communication.

3. **Combining with Words**:
    - Adpositions can be combined with affixes to create more complex and nuanced meanings. 

4. **Prefixes and Suffixes**:
    - With verbs, adpositions always transform into prefixes.
    - With nouns, adpositions transform into suffixes if they are directly linked to the noun.

5. **Acting as Modificational Particles**:
    - Adpositions can also act as modificational particles, meaning they can be placed at the end of the sentence to provide additional context or emphasis. When used this way, the entire action's meaning gets modified, much like using `Nek` (No, don't), which is a modificational particle that goes to the last place of the sentence.

### Examples

Let's explore some examples to illustrate how adpositions work in Balkeon:

#### Prepositions

- **Simple Sentence**:
    - English: "I am in the house."
    - Balkeon: "Aye estir in yereon."

- **Complex Sentence**:
    - English: "The book on the table."
    - Balkeon: "Bukeon on tebleon."

#### Postpositions

- **Simple Sentence**:
    - English: "The book is under the table."
    - Balkeon: "Bukeon estir ah tebleon."

- **Complex Sentence**:
    - English: "He ran beside me."
    - Balkeon: "O konip sail aye."

### Adpositions as Prefixes and Suffixes

In Balkeon, adpositions transform into prefixes when used with verbs and into suffixes when directly linked to nouns.

#### Transformation to Prefix with Verbs
- **Compatibility**:
    - Adpositions become prefixes when they are compatible with the verb, enhancing the verb's meaning.
    - Example: "in" (in) + "estir" (to be) → "inestirian" (to be in) is a compatible transformation.
    - Example: "frok" (from) + "anir" (to get) → "frokanirian" (to get from) is awkward and not used.
    - In such cases, keep the adposition separate: "Aye anir bukeon frok ensenemaon." (I get the book from the teacher.)

#### Transformation to Suffix with Nouns
- **Usage**:
    - Adpositions become suffixes, attaching directly to the noun, to indicate relationships.
    - Example: "kel" (with) + "bukeon" (book) → "bukeonkel" (with the book).
    - Example: "fen" (outside of) + "yereon" (house) → "yereonfen" (outside of the house).

### Practical Examples

- **Prefixes with Verbs**:
    - English: "He goes in."
    - Balkeon: "O ingonir."
    
    - English: "He goes around."
    - Balkeon: "O astasgonir."

- **Suffixes with Nouns**:
    - English: "With the book."
    - Balkeon: "Bukeonkel."
    
    - English: "Outside of the house."
    - Balkeon: "Yereonfen."

### Using Adpositions as Modificational Particles

When adpositions are used as modificational particles at the end of a sentence, the entire action's meaning gets modified, adding emphasis or changing the context of the verb.

- **Example**:
    - English: "He ran inside the house."
    - Balkeon: "O konip yereon in."

    - English: "Don't go inside of that."
    - Balkeon: "Gonaor atsel in nek."
