# Questions

The Questions are made through several alternatives, you can choose what to use and what fits you the most. 

We'll be using the following example and adapt it:

`Deon gonir kaneol?`
`Where's the dog going?`

## VSO

The first form is just switching up some word order and there you have it. 

`Deon gonir kaneol?`

## Emphasis Infix

If you ever stumble into a false question, like `I don't know where is the dog going` you can emphasize your doubt with `eh`. 

`Deon gonehir kaneol?`
`(Seriously) where is the dog going?`

## Alternative Question Words?

Yes, almost all Question Particles (Where, how, why), have their Regularized Question Form. 

`Has gonehir kaneol?`

Has is Where, although Has comes from Ast and Ats Deictics without that `t` that make them different, as if we were talking about an unknown location. 

> And the rest?

All words can have this treatment:

- Hunri = Kaum = How? (from Root Bunrib, changing the Initial Letter to H, and dropping the last hard vowel b)
- Hron = Krion = Kron = When (from Root Kron, changing the initial K to H)
- Hen = Ken/Kanem = Who (from H + gender suffixes + indefinite case)
> Ok, this is when I reveal I don't know what would Hel even mean.
- Hirian (Special case, just use H and add some tenses at the end, this creates a question regarding the action, let me explain this later)
- Haum = Kaum (both alternatives are valid to use, they come from switching up the first letter of Faum (manner way form)
- Hopar = Prok (from Root Sopar (Reason))

## The Action Question

The result of being able to suffix anything that moves is that in this Auxlang you can even suffix the Question Particle `H` with the Tenses Markers, this creates a question for the action that was mentioned previously in the conversation. 

```
Hingir yu? What are you doing? What is the action you are performing? 
Hip eo? What is the action it performed?
and a long etc...
```
