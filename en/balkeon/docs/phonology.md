# Phonology in Balkeon

Pronouncing and speaking Balkeon is not that difficult, the words are pronounced as they are read.

## Letters

### Vowels

Including the written and spoken form, there are 5 vowels: `a, e, i, o, u`, all pronounceable as in Esperanto. Additionally, a secret vowel is included, the [*schwa*](https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa). Its pronunciation is similar to that of English, being for Balkeon a wildcard when you are not able to pronounce a word.

**Examples of use:**

- Tutfosin, tutfaum  
- Always, anyway  

In these examples we have the letter `T` and the letter `F`, which when together usually cause problems when speaking, with the silent vowel *schwa* (we will represent it as **…ô**) it would be like this:  

- Tut…ôfosin, tut…ôfaum  

#### Additional Vowel: `√∂`  
The vowel `√∂` is used for contractions or as a variation of `eo` in spelling.  

### Consonants

There are 18 consonants, here is the list:  

- B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, R, S, T, W, X, Y, Z.  

## Modern Consonants  

- For `C`, its sound is `CH`. Its adoption has largely replaced the `CH` affricative. If you still want to use `CH`, it remains a stylistic choice.  
- For `X`, its sound is `SH`. Its use is less recommended than `C` for `CH` but is still a stylistic option.  
- For `Z`, its sound is `TS`. Its use is also barely recommended, another stylistic choice.  
- For `W`, it is used when `u` follows a vowel (e.g., `au` or `eu`).  

In case you need to know, the IPA for `Y` is: [ ù](https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EA%9E%B2). *That is your average Spanish ll/y*.  

### Affricates  

In Balkeon there are only 2: `ch, sh`.  

In case you need to know, the IPA for these is: [tÕ° É](https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africada_postalveolar_sorda) and [ É](https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fricativa_postalveolar_sorda).  

# Phonotactics  

- Balkeon is quite free with its rules, however it still has its restrictions.  
- Triptongs can never appear. If a triptong is formed by combining two roots, they must be separated using the wildcard `r`.  
- In 99% of cases, no word can begin with `s` or `l` if its successor consonant is the same or another consonant (e.g., `b, d, h, k, p, t, y`), including combinations like `bd`, `hk`, `kh`. There are fewer than 10 roots with these exceptions.  
- Adding to this, it is common practice that any borrowed word beginning with such combinations should either be simplified to a single consonant or have `e` added if appropriate (e.g., `espokeon`).  
- When converting a loanword to Balkeon ending in a vowel, `r` can be added to accommodate suffixes, or `b` if it ends with `u` followed by a vowel (`eu`, `au`). This is useful for converting proper names to Balkeon.  
- Two similar-sounding consonants cannot go together (e.g., `kh`, `bp`). If they arise from etymology, one of the two is canceled.  
- [Plurals](../../grammar/words/#plurals) have their own rules detailed in that section.
