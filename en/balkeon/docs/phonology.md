## Letters

### Vowels

Including the written and spoken form, there are 5 vowels: `a, e, i, o, u`, all pronounceable as in Esperanto, when speaking a secret vowel is included, the [*schwa*](https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa). Its pronunciation is similar to that of English, being for Balkeon a wildcard when you are not able to pronounce a word.

**Examples of use:**

- Tutfosin, tutfaum
- Always, anyway

In these examples we have the letter `T` and the letter `F`, which when together usually cause problems when speaking, with the silent vowel *schwa* (we will represent it as **…ô**) it would be like this:

- Tut…ôfosin, tut…ôfaum

### Consonants

There are 15 consonants, here is the list:

- B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, R, S, T, Y.

With the consonants the only issue would be the `C` that never appears alone, but accompanied by the `H`. In conclusion, they are almost the same sounds as in English, only in smaller quantities.

In case you need to know, the IPA for Y is: [ ù](https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EA%9E%B2). *That is your average Spanish ll/y*

### Affricates

In Balkeon there are only 2: `ch, sh`

In case you need to know, the IPA for these is: [tÕ° É](https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africada_postalveolar_sorda) and  É
