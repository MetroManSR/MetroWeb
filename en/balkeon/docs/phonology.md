# Phonology in Balkeon

Pronouncing and speaking Balkeon is not that difficult, the words are pronounced as they are read.

## Letters

### Vowels

Including the written and spoken form, there are 5 vowels: `a, e, i, o, u`, all pronounceable as in Esperanto, when speaking a secret vowel is included, the [*schwa*](https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa). Its pronunciation is similar to that of English, being for Balkeon a wildcard when you are not able to pronounce a word.

**Examples of use:**

- Tutfosin, tutfaum
- Always, anyway

In these examples we have the letter `T` and the letter `F`, which when together usually cause problems when speaking, with the silent vowel *schwa* (we will represent it as **…ô**) it would be like this:

- Tut…ôfosin, tut…ôfaum

### Consonants

There are 17 consonants, here is the list:

- B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, R, S, T, X, Y, Z.

## Modern Consonants

For `C` its sound is `CH`, since its adoption it has been spread and pretty much replaced the `CH` affricative. If you still want to use `CH` no one can tell you not to.

For `X` its sound is `SH` its use is less recommended than `C` for `CH` but it is just a stylistic choice.

For `Z` its sound is `TS` its use is also barely recommended, another stylistic option.

In case you need to know, the IPA for Y is: [ ù](https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EA%9E%B2). *That is your average Spanish ll/y*

### Affricates

In Balkeon there are only 2: `ch, sh`

In case you need to know, the IPA for these is: [tÕ° É](https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africada_postalveolar_sorda) and  É

# Phonotactics

- Balkeon is quite free with its rules, however it still has its restrictions.

- Tryptongs can never appear, if a tryptong is formed by combining two roots they must be separated using the wildcard `r`.

- In 99% of the cases no word can begin with `s` or `l` if its successor consonant is the same, a consonant, this includes consonants such as `b, d, h, k, p, t, y` plus any combination that can be made between them (`bd`, `hk`, `kh`). There are less than 10 roots with these exceptions.

- Adding to this it is common practice that any word borrowed from another language beginning in one of these combinations should either be simplified to a single consonant or have `e` added if appropriate) e.g. `espokeon`.

- When converting a loanword to Balkeon and it ends in a vowel, `r` can be added to place the appropriate suffix and `b` if possible when it end with `u` and behind it a vowel (`eu`, `au`).

- This is useful for converting Proper Names to Balkeon. 

- Two similar sounding consonants cannot go together, e.g. `kh`, `bp` when born of etymology, one of the two is cancelled.

- [Plurals](../../grammar/words/#plurals) have their own rules detailed in that section.
