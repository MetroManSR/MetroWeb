# Balkeon Root System

## Core Principles

1. **Root-Based Meaning**:
   - Static Roots = Fundamental states of being (`kan`=dogness)
   - Dynamic Roots = Fundamental actions (`am`=loving)

2. **Suffix Conversion**:
   - Static roots can take tense markers → become actions
   - Dynamic roots can take gender markers → become nouns

## Suffix Application

### Static Roots
**Primary Use**: Take gender markers to form nouns
- `kan` + `-eon` = `kaneon` (dog as entity)
- `kan` + `-ean` = `kanean` (female dog)

**Alternate Use**: Take tense markers to form existential verbs
- `kan` + `-ir` = `kanir` ("to dog" = to exist as a dog)
- `kan` + `-ip` = `kanip` ("was a dog")

### Dynamic Roots
**Primary Use**: Take tense markers to form verbs
- `am` + `-ir` = `amir` (loves)
- `am` + `-ip` = `amip` (loved)

**Alternate Use**: Take gender markers to form action nouns
- `am` + `-eon` = `ameon` (the action/essence of loving)
- `am` + `-on` = `amon` (male lover)

## Conversion Examples

1. Static → Action:
   - `arb` (tree) + `-ir` = `arbir` ("to tree" = to exist as a tree)
   - `akb` (water) + `-ib` = `akbib` ("will water" = will exist as water)

2. Dynamic → Entity:
   - `gon` (go) + `-eon` = `goneon` (the concept of going)
   - `sak` (make) + `-an` = `sakan` (female maker)

## Special Constructions

1. Infinitive Nominals:
   - `kanirian` ("to be a dog" as noun concept)
   - `amirian` ("to love" as noun concept)

2. Hybrid Forms:
   - `kanireon` (the state of being a dog)
   - `amireon` (the state of loving)

## Usage Rules

1. **Gender Markers**:
   - Always create noun forms
   - Can apply to any root type

2. **Tense Markers**:
   - Always create predicate forms
   - Can apply to any root type

3. **Position Locking**:
   - Only one suffix per root
   - No mixing (e.g., no `kanireonan`)
