### No

To say don't or not just add nek at the very end of the sentence.

One way to emphasize the negation is through not using nek at all, instead faumnem as an adverb.

A more colloquial way is by using nekin.

### Yes

To emphasize an action like what ‚Äúdo‚Äù does in ‚ÄúI did do that‚Äù add yek at the end of the sentence.

Faumtuti is a stronger emphasizer and yekin like nekin is the colloquial emphasizer

- Why weren't you doing? - ingipe yu nek?

- Future doer - irbeon
- Future receiver - inbeon

## Stress

- To stress the right vowel, you must always stress the second to last sylable on the first vowel. That's it.

- For emphasis like imperative, you can stress the last sylable on the first vowel
