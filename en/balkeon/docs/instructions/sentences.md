# Sentence Construction

For starters, sentences in Balkeon have the SVO configuration for affirmative sentences and VSO for question sentences, let's get to the raw stuff.

✨ I need to willingly give my school new chairs

👀 S AV AD CV AO MO 

🌟 Aye bolin nesir aenian os ensenatseonstan neobidu silseon

🚀 S AD AV DV AO MO ~~MP~~

🌟 Aye bolin aenir os ensenatseonstan. neobidu silseon nes

🚀 S AD CV DO MO AV ~~MP~~

- S = Subject, maybe a Pronoun, always present except for Aye, which can be omitted
- AD = Adverb, always behind the verb
* Adverbs take `-in` suffix when modifying an explicit verb, otherwise the suffix `-un` gets used. 
- AV = Auxiliary Verb, a Verb that allows to make a complex sentence, later on I will explain its especial case. 
- CV = Core Verb, Completely Mandatory Piece of the Sentence, always goes behind an AO or an MO.
- DO = Dative Object, secondary object to which the action is being done, also known as direct object, it **ALWAYS** takes `-stan` at the very end. 
- MO = Main Object, primary object that marks what object is the core of the action. 
- MP = Something that didn't appear in the example but needs to be explained, there are Modification Particles and they ALWAYS go at the END of the whole sentence. 

***Auxiliary Verbs***

- Verbs that exist to get linked to another Verb, they have two different modes of getting implemented, behind the Verb they are linked to and behind the Modification Particle Slot. 

- Behind the Main Verb they are conjugated normally and the MV ends in the Infinitive Tense. 

- Behind the MP it is another story, the Main Verb adopts the tense of the sentence and the AV loses its sufixes and is left with only the root(s). 

*When losing its suffixes the root deletes the last consonant if it is: B, D, P, T*

***The second AV case is Formal, the original way of speaking Balkeon***



## MODIFICATION PARTICLE

This particle can be `Nek`, can be `Ah`, can be `Ar`.

💫 He goes up the mountain
🪐 O gonir yameon ah

- `Ahgonirian` means `Go Up`, but in this case we take that prefix off the verb and move it to the end of the sentence to change its whole sense.

- This is similar to `O gonir ah yameon` and practically the same but here's the difference.

***Using the modification particle is Formal, Using the prefix of the verb as a Preposition is kinda informal, more details [here](https://www.metroman.me/en/balkeon/docs/instructions/formalityregister)***

*Particles Sei and Bir*

- These are special and never variable particles that mean "unknown subject told me" "X saw that". "They told me that the house didn't get bought = Yereon buyadosipe nek sei"

**LIMITATIONS**

🌟 We can't go up the mountain

🚀 Sayao kadir gonian yameon ah nek

OR

🚀 Sayao ahgonir yameon ka nek

NEVER

🙄 Sayao gonir yameon ka ah nek

*Actually you COULD say that, but it is highly informal and ambiguous*
