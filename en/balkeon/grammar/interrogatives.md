# Questions

In Balkeon, questions can be constructed in several ways, allowing you to choose the form that best suits your needs. We'll use the following example and adapt it:

**Example:**  
`Deon gonir kaneol?`  
*Where's the dog going?*

## VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) Structure

The first method involves simply rearranging the word order.

**Example:**  
`Deon gonir kaneol?`  
*Where's the dog going?*

## Emphasis Infix

If you encounter a false question, such as `I don't know where the dog is going,` you can emphasize your doubt with the infix `eh`.

**Example:**  
`Deon gonehir kaneol?`  
*(Seriously) where is the dog going?*

## Alternative Question Words

Almost all question particles (where, how, why) have their regularized question form.

**Example:**  
`Has gonehir kaneol?`  
*Where is the dog going?*

**Explanation:**  
"Has" is "Where." "Has" is derived from "Ast" and "Ats" deictics, minus the `t`, indicating an unknown location.

> **And the rest?**

All question words can be treated similarly:

- **Haum / Kaum:** *How?* (from Root "Faum") 
- **Hunri / Yuan:** *How much/many?* (from Root "Bunrib," changing the initial letter to "H," and dropping the final hard vowel "b")
- **Hoft / Yuanoften:** *How often* (from Root "Oft")
- **Hlast:** *How long* (duration, from Root "Last")
- **Hrats:** *How far* (from "Rats")
- **Hrast:** *How close* (from "Rast" )
- **Hras:** *How far/close* (from "Ras")
- **Hars:** *How old* (from Root "Yar") 
-  **Hron / Krion / Kron:** *When?* (from Root "Kron," changing the initial "K" to "H")
- **Hen / Ken / Kanem:** *Who?* (from "H" + gender suffixes + indefinite case)
  > Note: Unsure of what "Hel" would mean.
- **Hirian:** *What?* (Special case, use "H" and add tenses at the end to question the action)
- **Haum / Kaum:** *How?* (both valid alternatives, derived by changing the first letter of "Faum" (manner form))
- **Hopar / Prok:** *Why?* (from Root "Sopar" (Reason))
- **Heis / Kaul:** *Which?*

## The Action Question

Balkeon allows you to suffix the Question Particle `H` with tense markers, creating a question regarding the previously mentioned action.

**Examples:**

```
Hingir yu? What are you doing? What is the action you are performing?
Hip eo? What is the action it performed?
```
â€¦and many more.
