# Complex Sentences

A complex sentence is composed of two phrases, the dependent and the independent. In Balkeon the conjunction `Kua` is commonly used and there are more alternatives.

`I can consider that you have done nothing, from what you have told me`

This sentence should always be divided into three parts 1 [I can consider]2 [that you have done nothing] 3 [from what you have told me]

**Kua**

Form 1: `Kadir inmabian, pofrok emseon yu seyip ayestan, kua yu agdiro nemeon`

Form 2: `Inmabir, pofrok emseon yu seyip ayestan, kad, kua yu agdiro nemeon`

- The simplest, the third part is a direct object of the first part so it should be placed like this [1, 3, 2], always separating each part with a comma.

- In Form 2 the modal verb is moved to the end, becoming `kad`. Since Part 3 is a component directly related to Part 1, this modal verb is moved after Part 3.

**Without Kua Conjunction**

Form 1: `Kadir inmabian, pofrok emseon yu seyip ayestan, yu agdiro nemeon`

Form 2: `Inmabir, pofrok emseon yu seyip ayestan, kad, yu agdiro nemeon`

- This case is similar to the previous one, except that in Balkeon the conjunction `kua` is omittable.

**Substantivation of the second sentence**

Form 1: `Kadir inmabian yuos nemagdiroyeon, pofrok emseon yu seyip ayestan`

Form 2: `Kadir inmabian yuos nemagdiroreon, pofrok emseon yu seyip ayestan`

- Taking into account the great possibilities that Balkeon offers to compose words from others, we take the second part of the sentence and turn it into a Noun, [here](#sentence-fusion) more information.

**Past Infinitive of the Second Sentence**

Form 1: `Kadir inmabian yu nemagdipian, pofrok emseon (kua) yu seyip ayestan`
Form 2: `Pofrok emseon (kua) yu seyip ayestan, inmabir yu nemagdipian kad`

- In this case, we do the same, but we keep a second fused sentence without genitive, leaving a Past Infinitive `yu nemagdipian` in its place

- The choice is yours to put together this sentence in the style you prefer.

## Sentence Fusion

In Balkeon it is known that any word can be mixed with any word, Sentences are not the exception, specific rules have been prepared to achieve this:

- In order to make a Sentence Noun pair, the subject of the sentence is changed to genitive, we will use the Example above.

- `You haven't done anything` has the pronoun `You`, which is `Yu` in Balkeon (check [this](../../en/grammar/sentencewords/#personal-pronouns). This means that its genitive is `Yuos` (`You`)
- `You have done` becomes a [Preterite](../../en/grammar/words/#preterites), `agdiroreon`.
- `Nothing` is translated as `Nemeon`.

- The outcome is as follows: Yuos nemagdiroreon. `Nemeon` and `agdiroreon` merge to create a meaningful, though not very translatable, word.
