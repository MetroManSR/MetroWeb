### Explanation of Deictics in Balkeon

**Deictics** are essential linguistic elements used to indicate the location, time, person, or context of objects in relation to the speaker. Deixis helps specify references within discourse. Let's explore the deictics **"Ast"** (nearby) and **"Ats"** (far) in Balkeon and how they can be used.

#### Spatial Deictics in Balkeon:

1. **Nearby Deictic - "Ast":**
   - **"Ast"** signifies proximity to the speaker.
     - Examples: *"Astyereon"* (this house) and *"Astlibreon"* (this book).

2. **Far Deictic - "Ats":**
   - **"Ats"** denotes something distant from the speaker.
     - Examples: *"Atsyereon"* (that house) and *"Atslibreon"* (that book).

#### Impact on Meaning:

When used as prefixes, **"Ast"** and **"Ats"** provide immediate spatial context without the need for the suffix **"el":**

- Example without "el" Suffix:
  - *"Astyereon"* - This house (nearby house).
  - *"Astlibreon"* - This book (nearby book).

#### Integration with Suffixes and Infixes:

By combining **"Ast"** and **"Ats"** with various suffixes, you can create nuanced meanings:

1. **Person or Thing Suffix - "em":**
   - *"Astem"* - This person or thing (nearby person or thing).
   - *"Atsem"* - That person or thing (far person or thing).

2. **Adjective Suffix - "idu":**
   - *"Astidu"* - Nearby attribute (e.g., this-kind).
   - *"Atsidu"* - Far attribute (e.g., that-kind).

3. **Adverb Suffix - "in":**
   - *"Astin"* - Near.
   - *"Atsin"* - Far.

4. **Infinitive Verb Suffix - "irian":**
   - *"Ast(est)irian"* - To be near.
   - *"Ats(est)irian"* - To be far.

### Temporal Deictics:

1. **Kron - Temporal Context:**
   - **"Astkron"** (near time) and **"Atskron"** (far time) provide temporal references.
     - Examples:
       - *"Astkron"* - Now.
       - *"Astkrin"* - Now (Adverbial Form). 
       - *"Atskrin"* - Then (Adverbial Form). 
     
### Personal Deictics:

Personal deictics help clarify relationships and points of view:

1. **Personal Prefix - "Em":**
   - Object/Animal: *"Emeon"* (some animal/object).
   - Female: *"Eman"* (some woman).
   - Male: *"Emon"* (some man).
   - Unspecified Gender: *"Emaon"* (some man or woman).
  
> With ats and ast added to these you get things like "Astemon" this man. 

### Contextual Deictics:

1. **Adverb Form - "In":**
   - Acts as an adverb to provide context.
     - Examples:
       - *"Astin"* - Here, nearby.
       - *"Atsin"* - There, far away.

### Comparative Deictics:

1. **Comparison with "Dan" (than):**
   - Examples:
     - *"Astupridu dan"* - Closer than (nearby comparison).
     - *"Atsupridu dan"* - Further than (faraway comparison).

### Interrogative Deictics:

1. **Special Prefix - "K":**
   - Examples:
     - *"Kats"* - Where (far context)?
     - *"Kast"* - Where (nearby context)?

### Adjective Forms:

1. **Nearby Adjective - "Astidu":**
   - **"Ast"** + **"idu"** (adjective suffix)
   - **Meaning:** Describing something as nearby or close.
   - Example Sentence: *"Astidu yereon"* - This house is nearby.

2. **Far Adjective - "Atsidu":**
   - **"Ats"** + **"idu"** (adjective suffix)
   - **Meaning:** Describing something as far away or distant.
   - Example Sentence: *"Atsidu libreon"* - That book is far.

### Conclusion:

Using **"Ast"** and **"Ats"** as prefixes (or infixes) in Balkeon allows for clear and precise spatial context. These elements are flexible, enabling various transformations and combinations with suffixes to enhance communication effectively. Exploring the potential uses of these deictics further reveals Balkeon's rich linguistic framework.
