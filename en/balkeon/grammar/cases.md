### First Case

## Dative

- The Dative is always the one to receive, suffer or endure the action, in this case it is `Kateon`, therefore it should be given the [Dative Suffix](../words/#dative-suffix) always whenever there is also an Accusative Case in the Sentence.

## Genitive

- The Genitive is the Possessive particle, in Balkeon they get the Suffix `os` at the end of the word.

- `cat` `kateonos`

- Like English, the order is like this, `Cat's Food` `Kateonos Namneon`
