# Sentence Construction

The basic thing about sentences in Balkeon is that they are configured in SVO (affirmative sentences) and VSO (interrogative sentences). Now I start the hardest part

✨I have to give new chairs to my school soon

👀 S VA AD VP OD OI

🌟 Aye fruin dabir aenian os ensenatseonstan neobidu silseon

🚀 S AD VA VP OI OD ~~PM~~

🌟 Aye fruin aenir os ensenatseonstan neobidu silseon dab

🚀 S AD VA VP OI OD ~~PM~~

- S = Subject, can be a Pronoun, must always be specified unless it is Aye, which can be omitted
- AD = Adverb, always after the verb
* The AD always take the suffix `-in` when modifying an explicit verb, otherwise the suffix `-un` is used. - VA = Auxiliary Verb, a verb that allows the creation of complex sentences, having to help, trying to order.
- VP = Main Verb, a completely obligatory part of a sentence, it always follows the indirect or direct object.
- OI = Indirect Object , secondary object to which the action is performed, this always has the suffix `-stan` at the end of everything.
- OD = Direct Object, in a sentence with the OI it is the object that receives the action, being what is deals with the sentence.
- PM = Something that did not come out in the example but that should be explained later, are Modificational Particles whose purpose is to alter the meaning of the verb from almost the end of the sentence, right after Nek.

***Verbs Auxiliaries***

- Verbs that exist to be connected to other Verbs, have two ways of being implemented: behind the Verb to which they are connected and behind where the Modification Particles go.

- After the VP they take the verb tense of the sentence and the VP is conjugated in the corresponding infinitive.

- It is another story when it is placed after the PM, the VP adopts the verb tense, the VA loses its suffixes and ends up remaining only with its roots.

***The second form of the Auxiliary Verb is Formal, the original form***

## PARTICLES MODIFICATIONAL

These particles can be `Nek`, `Ah`, `Ar`. (See more particles in Modificational Particles)

💫 Go up the mountain

🪐 O gonir yameon ah

- `Ahgonirian` means `Climb`, but in this case we take out the prefix to the verb and move it to the end of the sentence to change its entire meaning.

- This is similar to `O gonir ah yameon` and practically the same but here is the difference.

***The modifying particle is used for formal context, using the verb prefix as a preposition is quite informal***

*Sei particles and Bir*

- These are special, invariable particles that translate as "an unknown subject told me" "X saw". "I was told that the house was not bought = Yereon buyestipe nek sei"

**LIMITATIONS**

🌟 We cannot go up the mountain

🚀 Sayao kadir gonian yameon ah nek

Or

🚀 Sayao ahgonir yameon kad nek

NEVER

🙄 Sayao gonir yameon kad ah nek

*Actually you COULD use the third form But it's too informal and ambiguous*
