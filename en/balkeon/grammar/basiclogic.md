# Basic Logic
## Negation and opposites
### Nek
Turns yes into no, and no into yes.
Examples:
    nek + yuben = not young
    nek + hapi = not happy
### Tan
Gives the semantic opposite.
Examples:
    tan + yuben = old
    tan + hapi = sad
    
## Quantifiers
- Tut = every
- Part = at least one
- Half = exactly 50%
### Usage
Add a quantifier to the start of a word to create meaning.
Examples:
    tut + manon = wholly man
    tut + adjective + manon = a man with wholly a quality
    tut + em + manson = every man
    manon os tuteon = the whole of a man
    
## Combination
Use only one or two logic words at a time:
- Tan tut = "no one"
- Tan part = "at least one doesn't"
- Tan half = half nek
- Nek half = "not exactly half"
  
## Recap
1. Need to say NOT? Use nek
2. Want the opposite? Use tan
3. Talking about amount? Choose:
    - All = tut
    - Some = part
    - Half = half
