# Basic Logic

## Negation and opposites

### Nek
Nek turns yes into no, and no into yes.
Examples:
- nek + yuben = not young
- nek + hapi = not happy

### Tan
Tan gives the semantic opposite.
Examples:
- tan + yuben = old
- tan + hapi = sad
    
## Quantifiers
- Tut = every
- Part = at least one
- Half = exactly 50%
  
### Usage
Add a quantifier to the start of a word to create meaning.
Examples:
- tut + manon = wholly man
- tut + adjective + manon = a man with wholly a quality
- tut + em + manson = every man
- manon os tuteon = the whole of a man
    
## Combination
Use only one or two logic words at a time:
- Tan tut = "no one"
- Tan part = "at least one doesn't"
- Tan half = half nek
- Nek half = "not exactly half"
  
## Recap
- Need to say NOT? Use nek
- Want the opposite? Use tan
- Talking about amount? Choose:
    - All = tut
    - Some = part
    - Half = half
