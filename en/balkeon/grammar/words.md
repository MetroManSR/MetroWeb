### No

To say no to not doing something, use nek at the end of the sentence.

One way to emphasize negation is through the adverb faumnem, without using nek

A more colloquial way is through the adverb nekin.

### Yes

To emphasize an action Saying ‚ÄúYes I did‚Äù uses yek at the end of the sentence.

Faumtuti is a stronger emphasizer and just like before you can use yekin for emphasis colloquially.
