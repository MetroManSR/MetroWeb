# Word Construction

In Balkeon, words are constructed with what the user requires. Detailed information will be found on the corresponding pages.

Consider that inside `[]` you will find Necessary Particles and `()` for Optional Particles subject to conditions.

## Nouns and Adjectives

`[Root or roots](Adjective) (Plural)[Gender](Grammatical Case)`

- The Adjective Particle is `-id-`, it serves to determine that the word is an Adjective.
- Plurals can be `s, us, r` depending on the [conditions](#plurals) detailed below.
- Genders are the [Suffixes](#gender-suffixes) that define the object or person of the Noun or Adjective, detailed in the [Formality Guide](../formalityguide).
- The Grammatical Case Particle defines what function the word fulfills. It will always be connected to the noun, and there will soon be a web page that will explain it.

## Verbs

`[Root or Roots](Adjective) (Statifier) (Time or Grammatical Mood)`

- The Adjective Particle in a Verb is optional; you can use it to reconfirm that you are mentioning or giving quality to the subject or object.
- Stative Suffixes can be `-ados-`, `-est-`, `-es-`. More information [here](#grammatical-tense-suffixes).
- The last element would be the Verbal Tense or Mood. More information [here](#grammatical-tense-suffixes). It is optional since the Auxiliary Verbs have an alternative mode explained [here](../sentences/#auxiliary-verbs) in its homonymous section.

## Adverbs

`[Root or roots](Adverbiator)`

- The Adverbiator is `-in` or `-un`. Since the Adverb is independent without a direct Verb to modify, the speaker can choose to give it the suffix `-un`. Some adverbs do not take this suffix and all can take the Deductive Suffix when appearing in a list.

## Gender Suffixes

- on - Man
- an - Woman
- en - Neuter or Animal (Little used, coming from Modern Balkeon)
- aon - Man or Woman
- eon - Inanimate or Male Animal
- ean - Female Animal
- u - Deductive

## Plurals

- Plurals go in the position detailed above. The infix `-s-` is mostly used, but here I detail when alternatives are used.
  - With the consonants `B, C, D, G, P, S, X, Y, Z` the plural is with `R`.
  - After the affricates `CH and SH` as well as combinations of two consonants that include `R, L, and S` (`KL, SK, TL, GR, RG etc.`) `-us-` is used.

## Dative Suffix

- stan (I want it, aye bolir eostan)
- More info about the Dative Case [here](../cases).

## Grammatical Tense Suffixes

üëâ The infinitives of verbs are `irian` and `ian`. The first case is used in Very Formal Speech and when the verb is not linked to any other verb. The second is used for the rest of the cases, especially when it is linked to a modal or auxiliary verb.

### No

To say no, to not do something, use `nek` at the end of the sentence.

One way to emphasize negation is through the adverb `faumnem`, without using `nek`.

A more colloquial way is through the adverb `nekin`.

### Yes

To emphasize an action by saying ‚ÄúYes I did‚Äù you use `yek` at the end of the sentence.

`Faumtut` is a stronger emphasizer and just like before you can use `yekin` for emphasis colloquially.

- Am I doing? - Agdingir aye?
- Why weren't you doing it? - Prok agdingip yu nek?

## Preterite Tenses

The following rules must be followed to create the Preterite Tenses:

- If the Preterite Tense is Active, that is, it indicates something that is doing something, the correct [Grammatical Tense Suffix](#grammatical-tense-suffixes) is used plus the groups of Suffixes that you need at the moment.
- If it is Passive, you place `ac` before the tense and the rest is the same as always.

> Amachireon: Loved, person that receives/is loved, Amestireon: Loved, person that is loved, Amireon: Lover, person that loves. 

- In Balkeon, the Preterites are useful for [Complex Sentences](../complexsentences) and other special words.

## Stress

- To stress the correct vowel, you must always accentuate the second to last syllable of the first vowel. That's all.
- To stress as an imperative, you can accentuate the last syllable of the first vowel.

## Compound Words

- In Balkeon, any word can be mixed with another.
- Blending must be done by reading from right to left.
- The only exception to this rule is the word `em`. Em never goes at the beginning, unless you want to indicate `some`.
- When making a compound word, take into account the [affixes](.././affixes).
- Balkeon rejects triphthongs when compounding roots.

## Rules for Affixes

- [Affixes](.././affixes) can be 99% flexible but have limitations.
- Any affix can become a complete word unless:
  - If it ends in a vowel, the bridging wildcard `r` is added.
  - If there is already a root occupying the same sequence of letters (`-ut-` derogatory, `ut` customary) a `ch` is added at the beginning if it starts with a vowel or an `e` if it starts with a consonant (`chutideon` to be ugly/horrible).

## An and Aen, As and Asn

Let's talk about these four affixes; they can all work alone but are more common mixed except for `an` and `aenirian`. Let's use `Kaneon` (Dog).

- Kanasirian: Becoming oneself a dog. Kanasnirian: to transform into a dog.
- Kananirian: To receive a dog, to get a dog. Kanaenirian: To give a dog.
