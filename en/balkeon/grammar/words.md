# Word construction

In Balkeon, words are constructed with what the user requires, detailed information will be found on the corresponding pages.

Consider that inside `[]` you will find Necessary Particles and `()` for Optional Particles subject to Conditions.

## Nouns and Adjectives

`[Root or roots](Adjective) (Plural)[Gender](Grammatical Case)`

- The Adjective Particle is `-id-`, it serves to determine that the word is an Adjective.
- Plurals can be `s, us, r` depending on the [Conditions](#plurals) detailed below.
- Gender are the [Suffixes](#gender-suffixes) that define the object or person of the Noun or Adjective, detailed in [Formality Guide](../formalityguide).
- The Grammar Case Particle defines what function the Word Fulfills, it will always go connected to the Noun,there will soon be a web page that will explain it.

## Verbs

`[Root or Roots](Adjective) (Statifier) ‚Äã‚Äã(Time or Grammatical Mood)`

- The Adjective Particle in a Verb is optional at the point which you can choose to use to reconfirm that you are mentioning or giving quality to the subject or object.
- Stative Suffixes can be `-ados-`,.`-est-`, `-es-`, more information [here](#grammatical-tense-suffixes).
- The last element would be the Verbal Tense or Mode, more information [here](#grammatical-tense-suffixes), it is optional since the Auxiliary Verbs have an alternative mode explained [here](../sentences/#auxiliary-verbs) in its homonymous section.

## Adverbs

`[Root or roots](Adverbiator)`

- The Adverbiator is `-in` or `-un`, since the Adverb is independent without a direct Verb to modify, the speaker can choose to give it the suffix `-un`. Some adverbs do not take this suffix and all can take the Deductive Suffix when appearing in a list.

## Gender Suffixes
- on - Man
- an - Woman
- en - Neuter or Animal (Little used, coming from from Modern Balkeon)
- aon - Man or Woman
- eon - Inanimate or Male Animal
- ean - Female Animal
- u - Deductive

## Plurals

- Plurals go in the position detailed above, the infix `-s-` is mostly used but here I detail when alternatives are used.

- With the consonants `B, D, G, P , S, Y` the Plural is with `R`.
- After the affricates `CH and SH` as well as combinations of two consonants that include `R, L and S` (`KL, SK, TL, GR, RG etc. `) is used `-us-`.

## Dative Suffix
- stan (I want it, aye bolir eostan)
- More info about Dative Case [here](../cases).
## Grammatical Tense Suffixes

üëâ The infinitives of verbs are `irian` and `ian`. The first case is used in Very Formal Speech and when the verb is not linked to any other verb, the second for the rest of the cases, especially when it is linked to a modal or auxiliary verb.

| | Simple | Continuous | Perfect | Perfect Continuous |
| -------- | ------ | -------- | ------- - | ----------------- |
| Past | ip | ingip | ipo | inkip |
| Present | ir | ingir | iro | inkir |
| Future | ib | ingib | ibo | inkib |

| More verb forms | Imperative | Conditional | Estar and Passive mode | Ser |

### No

To say no, to not do something, use nek at the end of the sentence.

One way to emphasize negation is through the adverb faumnem, without using nek.

A more colloquial way is through the adverb nekin.

### Yes

To emphasize an action by saying ‚ÄúYes I did‚Äù you use yek at the end of the sentence.

Faumtuti is a stronger emphasizer and just like before you can use yekin for emphasis colloquially.

## Related

- Am I doing? - Agdingir aye?
- Why weren't you doing it? - Prok agdingip yu nek?

## Preterite Tenses

The following rules must be followed to create the Preterite Tenses:

- If the Preterite Tense is Active, that is, it indicates something that is doing something, the correct [Grammatical Tense Suffix](#grammatical-tense-suffixes) is used plus the groups of Suffixes that you need at the moment.

- If it is Passive, the `i` is removed from the infix and ach is added (for example, leaving `achpeon`), the rest is the same as always.

- In Balkeon the Preterites They are useful for [Complex Sentences](../complexsentences) and the occasional different word.

## Stress

- To stress the correct vowel, you must always accentuate the second to last syllable of the first vowel. That's all.

- To stress as an imperative, you can accentuate the last syllable of the first vowel

## Compound Words

- In Balkeon any word can be mixed to another.

- Blending must be done by reading from right to left.

- The only exception to this rule is the word `em`. Em never goes at the beginning, unless you want to indicate `some`.

- When making a compound word take into account the [affixes](.././affixes).

- Balkeon rejects triptongs when compounding roots.

## Rules for affixes 

- [Affixes](.././affixes) can be 99% flexible, but have limitations.

- Any affix can become a complete word unless:

- If it ends in a vowel, the bridging wildcard `r` is added. 

- If there is already a root occupying the same sequence of letters (`-ut-` derogatory, `ut` customary) a `ch` is added at the beginning if it starts with a vowel or an `e` if it starts with a consonant (`chutideon` to be ugly/horrible).
