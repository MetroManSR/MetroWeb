# Determinants

In Balkeon, there exists a remnant of a determinant suffix `el`. This suffix is not always used, as some prepositions and words already specify their roles in the sentence.

## Articles?

No, there are no articles in Balkeon. Refer to the Cases Page to learn more about Definite and Indefinite Cases.

## Demonstratives

These are combinations of deictics and the demonstrative suffix:

- **Astel, atsel:** This, that

## Possessives

Possessives lost their determinant position and became fully established by the Genitive Case.

## Quantifiers

Using the determinant suffix with these particles is optional but recommended to clarify and distinguish different sentence components.

### Examples

- **Yumel:** many
- **Emel:** some
- **Keanel:** any
- **Kicel:** each

## Numbers

It is also recommended to use the suffix with numbers to clarify their role in the sentence.

- **Uan, uanel:** one
- **Cos, cosel:** two
