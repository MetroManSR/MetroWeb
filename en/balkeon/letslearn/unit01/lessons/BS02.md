# Lesson 2: Pronunciation and Alphabet

Balkeon is pronounced in a clear and direct manner, similar to Spanish. This means that each letter has a consistent sound.

# The Alphabet
The Balkeon alphabet consists of 21 letters: 5 vowels and 16 consonants:

A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, X, Y, Z

All letters are pronounced as in Esperanto or Spanish.

The three special letters are: `C, X, and Z`.

> `Y` is pronounced like Spanish `LL` and like English words Yellow or Yes

## Consonants and Vowels
These letters are pronounced the same way as in Spanish, with three special consonants:

- The `C` is pronounced `Ch` and its use is more diversified than its predecessor `Ch`.

- The `X` is pronounced `Sh` and its use is less frequent than `Sh`.

- The `Z` is equivalent to `Ts`, and it also has a lesser use than `Ts` but is a valid replacement.

## Affricates
There are only two unique consonant combinations: `CH` and `SH`.
- **CH**: Similar to the "ch" sound in words like "chico".
- **SH**: Similar to the "sh" sound in "shhh".
