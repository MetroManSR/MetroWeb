# Lesson 2: Pronunciation and Alphabet

Balkeon is pronounced in a way that is very similar to Spanish. For English speakers, this means that each letter generally represents one consistent sound, which is often different from how letters can represent multiple sounds in English.

## The Alphabet
The Balkeon alphabet is made up of 19 letters: 5 vowels and 14 consonants:

A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, Y

From this list, the only special letter is `C`, which only appears in the combination `Ch`.

## Vowels
In Balkeon, the vowels are pronounced as follows:
- **A** as in "father"
- **E** as in "bet"
- **I** as in "machine"
- **O** as in "bought"
- **U** as in "put"

## Consonants
The consonants are generally pronounced as they are in English, with the exception of a few:
- **C** only appears in the combination `Ch`, which is pronounced like the "ch" in "cheese".
- **Y** is pronounced like the "y" in "yes".

## Affricates
There are only two unique consonant combinations: `CH` and `SH`.
- **CH**: Similar to the "ch" in English words like "cheese".
- **SH**: Similar to the "sh" in English words like "shhh".
