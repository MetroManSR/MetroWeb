# Lesson 02: Affixes

[Affixes](https://www.metroman.me/en/balkeon/docs/affixes/) play a crucial role in the Balkeon language, allowing for the modification and expansion of root words to convey different meanings and grammatical functions. Affixes can be prefixes, suffixes, or infixes, and they provide a flexible and efficient way to build vocabulary.

## Understanding Affixes

### Types of Affixes

1. **Prefixes**:
    - These are added to the beginning of a root word to modify its meaning. In some advanced contexts, prefixes might evolve to play more specific roles in sentence structure.

2. **Suffixes**:
    - These are added to the end of a root word to change its grammatical function or add new meaning.

3. **Infixes**:
    - These are inserted within the root word itself, often to convey specific grammatical nuances.

### How Affixes Work

1. **Flexibility**:
    - Balkeon allows for a high degree of flexibility with affixes. Nearly any affix can be added to a root word to create a new word or modify its meaning. However, there are some rules and limitations to ensure clarity and coherence.

2. **Perfect Fitting of Infixes**:
    - In Balkeon, infixes are designed to fit perfectly with root words, like puzzle pieces, ensuring seamless integration without the need for additional wildcards.

3. **Affixes Becoming Words**:
    - If there is already a root occupying the same sequence of letters (e.g., `-ut-` for derogatory, `ut` for customary), adjustments are made:
        - Add `c` at the beginning if the affix starts with a vowel.
        - Add `e` at the beginning if the affix starts with a consonant.
    - This conflict resolution mechanism allows affixes to potentially become full words. For instance, when modifying affixes to avoid conflicts, they can develop distinct meanings and functions within the language.

4. **Adapting to Context**:
    - Affixes can be adapted based on the specific context of the sentence to ensure proper meaning and grammatical accuracy.

### Examples

Let's look at some examples to illustrate how affixes work in Balkeon:

#### Prefixes

- **Without Affix**:
    - Root word: "lern" (to learn)
    - Example: "lernirian" (to learn)

- **With Prefix**:
    - Prefix: "re-"
    - Result: "relernirian" (to relearn)

#### Suffixes

- **Without Affix**:
    - Root word: "hab" (to have)
    - Example: "habir" (I have)

- **With Suffix**:
    - Suffix: "-eon" (noun form)
    - Result: "habireon" (possession)

#### Infixes

- **Without Affix**:
    - Root word: "sil" (chair)
    - Example: "sil" (chair)

- **With Infix**:
    - Infix: "-up-" (group)
    - Result: "silupeon" (group of chairs)

## Practical Application

Affixes allow for the creation of complex words and sentences without the need for additional root words.
