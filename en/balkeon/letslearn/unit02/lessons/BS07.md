# Verb Tenses, Past, Present, Future

The conjugation of verbs in Balkeon is simple. For this lesson, only 3 suffixes need to be considered:

- **Past**: `-ip`
- **Present**: `-ir`
- **Future**: `-ib`

Using the verb **namnirian** as an example:

- Past: `namnip`
- Present: `namnir`
- Future: `namnib`

The infinitive for now will be `irian`, which is the dictionary infinitive. Its other uses will be explained later.

## Negation 

For now I will teach you that we negate a sentence with the particle `Nek` at the end of the sentence, this will work as your Negation until I say otherwise.

### Usage Example

***I have animals
I don't have animals***

```
Aye habir animalseon
Aye habir animalseon nek
```
