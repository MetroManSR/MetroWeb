The pronouns are as in English, and most of them can be declined with gender suffixes. The exception is `Yu`.

### Singular

- I = Aye
- You (singular) = Yu
- He, She, It = O, A/ea, Eo

### Plural

- We (masculine, feminine) = Saye/Sayeo, Sayea
- You (plural, vosotros, vosotras) = Siyu
- They (masculine, feminine, neuter) = So/seo, Sa/sea

## Rules

- **Aye** is an ancient pronoun whose base is the most commonly used, despite the `e` suffix being the neutral suffix.
- **Yu** is not declinable.
