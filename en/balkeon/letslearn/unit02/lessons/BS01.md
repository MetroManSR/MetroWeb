# Nouns

Nouns in Balkeon have different genders which to simplify this lesson have `Suffix: eon` for Inanimate Objects and Male Animals.

I will use examples from this [Page](../../../unit01/lessons/BS03#basic-nouns)

# Plurals

For plurals in Balkeon, add `-s-` before the gender suffix `-eon`.

> If the word root ends with a strong consonant `(B, D, G, P, S, Y)`, add `-r-` before `-eon` instead of `s`.
> If the word root ends with an Affricative `(CH, SH)` add `-us-` instead of `s`.

## Examples:

- Sileon -> Silseon

- Arbeon -> Arbreon

- Bukeon -> Bukreon
