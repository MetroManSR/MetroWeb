# Compound Words - Part 1

In Balkeon, all words can be combined with others, as long as the final result makes sense.

If you want to create a compound word, you must think of the meaning of that word in reverse. For example, what is a teacher? It's a person who teaches. Using the words `Ensenirian` (to teach) and `emon` (person), we get `Ensenemon` (teacher).

### Combination Technique

1. Reverse the definition (teach person).
2. Use the pure roots: `ensen` (teach) and `em` (person).
3. Add the plural and gender infix if applicable (`on`).

### Example

Let's take the word **Afthalfdiyin**:

- `Aft` (after)
- `half` (half)
- `diy` (day)
- `in` (Adverb)

Is it too difficult to pronounce? In compound words, if you find it challenging to combine an initial sound and a final sound, you can use a support vowel, similar to a muted `u` (schwa). Thus, `Afthalfdiyin` becomes `Aftəhalfədiyin`, where `ə` represents the schwa.

### Limits?

There are no limits. Just reverse the definition of your word, add the appropriate suffix, and you're done.
